in 1117 AD.Scholars are divided about the reasons for the 
construction of the temple. The military successes 
of Vishnuvardhana is considered a probable 
reason.Some scholars believe Vishnuvardhana 
commissioned the temple to surpass his overlord,
King Vikramaditya VI of the Western Chalukya 
Empire (who ruled from Basavakalyan), after his
initial military victories against the Chalukyas.

 stretch of track from Sakleshapur to the Subrahmanya railroad station,
 which was suspended in 1996 to convert the 
 gauge from meter to broad gauge. In the 2007 the 
 train service was commissioned and nowadays 
 many people use the train to reach Donigal.
 This track, that traverses some distance of the 
 Western Ghats, had been abandoned, but now the
  track has been converted to broad-gauge. 
  It forms a part of 56.80 km stretch from 
  Sakaleshapura to Kukke Subrahmanya, dotted by 
  58 tunnels, 109 bridges and about 25 waterfalls.
